"""On-save syntax checking.

"""

# Notes:
# - -Zno-trans has been deprecated, and will only be available with the
#   nightly compiler starting with rust 1.19.  Using "cargo check" is the
#   preferred alternative, though it currently has some limitations. See:
#
#       - Unstable flags removed:
#         https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/31847
#
#       - Cargo check added in rust 1.16:
#         https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/3296 (based on original
#         "cargo check" addon https://github.com/rsolomo/cargo-check/)
#
#       - RLS was recently released
#         (https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rls).  It's unclear to me if
#         this will perform full-linting that could replace this or not.
#
#       - "cargo check" ignores #[test]:
#         https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/3431
#
#       - "cargo check" will not re-issue errors/warnings if nothing has
#         changed.  This generally should not be a problem since on-save
#         syntax only runs after the file has been saved which updates the
#         timestamp, but it's something to be careful about.  See:
#         https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/3624
#
# - -Zno-trans prevents some warnings and errors from being generated. For
#   example, see const-err.rs.  "cargo check" does not have this problem.
#   Other issues:
#       - Errors generated by compiling an extern crate do not not output as
#         json.
